        <p>The Gibson Les Paul is a solid body electric guitar that was first sold by the Gibson Guitar Corporation in 1952.[1] The Les Paul was designed by Gibson president Ted McCarty, factory manager John Huis and their team with some input from and endorsement by guitarist Les Paul.</p>
		
        <p>Its typical design features a solid mahogany body with a carved maple top and a single cutaway, a mahogany set-in neck with a rosewood fretboard, two pickups with independent volume and tone controls, and a stoptail bridge, although variants exist. </p>
        
        <p>The Les Paul was originally offered with a gold finish and two P-90 pickups. In 1957, humbucking pickups were added, along with sunburst finishes in 1958. <b> The sunburst 1958–1960 Les Paul </b> – today one of the best-known electric guitar types in the world – was considered a failure, with low production and sales.</p>
